  Learn how to write a Lighthouse audit guide.

## Principles

The main goal of each audit guide is to answer the following questions:

What is this audit measuring?
Why should I care about fixing this?
How do I fix my site so that this audit passes?

## Audience

People coming from the Lighthouse report

More specifically, the people who have failed the audit. We assume that
people are less likely to visit the documentation for audits that they're already passing.

## Get started

Make a copy of `src/site/_drafts/_template-audit-post/index.md`.

Submit a PR in Lighthouse to link to the guide
