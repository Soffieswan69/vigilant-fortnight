# Introduction to Intrinsic Layout

Heard this term yet in the context of web; [intrinsic web design](https://adactio.com/journal/13671)? [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons) **astutely coined it,** advocates it, and [demonstrates](https://labs.jensimmons.com) it. She's rad.

## What is it?
Intrinsic Web Design, **in Jen's words** while [chatting with Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2018/05/02/transcript-intrinsic-web-design-with-jen-simmons-the-big-web-show/) on [The Big Web Show](https://5by5.tv/bigwebshow):

> Intrinsic Web Design is a name that I gave to this new era, because I think we‚Äôre really in a new era of layout design... it‚Äôs not that float-based thing where everything‚Äôs set in widths with using percents. It‚Äôs this new set of technologies.
<br><br>
It‚Äôs not just because the tech is new, it‚Äôs also because the possibilities of what you can actually do are new, and the ways in which you can get content to morph and shift and change based on how much space is available is actually really different than Responsive Web Design.
<br><br>
... it includes CSS Grid, but it‚Äôs not just about CSS Grid. It‚Äôs also about using Flexbox, and kind of rediscovering what Flexbox is actually intended to be for. Plus, it‚Äôs about using some floats sometimes, using things like CSS shapes or object-fit, using a flow content, using multi-column. Some of these things are old, and they‚Äôve been around for a long time, but it‚Äôs about thinking about the whole system of layout, and how all these pieces fit together in a brand new way.

I'm **stoooooked** on it! I've been exploring, building apps and prototyping with it, and it's certainly a **new era of layout** we're in! I must **share with you the joy** as it's applied to my day to day.

<br><br>

# Why study intrinsic CSS concepts?
Here's a couple reasons, though there's plenty more:

**1) Too often the front-end instigates limitations that affect more systems and folks than it should.**

Ever been in a CMS with an odd text length limit on a field that's hindering you from effective articulation? Ever told a copywriter they can't say that there or else it breaks the component or layout?

<br>

**2) Too often the front-end stifles proper communication or implementations because of it's percieved inflexibility.**

Let's confront this. Let's investigate how much flexibility we have these days. **Let's simulate the chaos of user generated content** to put our layouts and components to the test, with the goal of **building layout algorythyms** that elegantly handle the changing contexts and content.

<br><br><br><br>

# Tangible learning
Intrinsic definitions get abstract, so I'd like to **define it tangibly and visibly together.**

Our overarching task throughout this guide is to **lay out the following design,** as a practical way of learning the ropes. It might not look like much, but it's **packed with learning opportunities!** üíÄü§ò

## Prepare to
- **lean into content variability**: aka assume text/images are out of our control
- **simulate chaos**: aka simulate content variability
- lean into **[css grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)**
- keep our **DOM shallow**: avoid superfluous HTML elements
- write semantic HTML
- **limit [fixed units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/)**
- **limit defining heights** (though I'll demo exceptions!)
- **limit writing @media queries**
- **limit `grid-template-areas`** usage: it enables creative layouts but they have high specificity
- **curb** our **grid happy tendencies**: perhaps flexbox is better
- use [**css variables**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/start-using-css-custom-properties/)
- fix the layout at smaller viewports **using our best judgement**
- use [tomorrow's CSS today](https://preset-env.cssdb.org)
- take a [Layout Challenge](/layout/intrinsic-7_card/codelab)

## By the end
- be confident **when playing with layout**
- be confident in **refactoring layout**
- **distinguish** when **flexbox or grid** are appropriate
- **leverage** the size of your **content**
- use **less** `grid-template-areas`
- **take snippets** back to your product/project
- engineer **[resilient](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/resilient-web-design/) and intrinsic** CSS layout algorithms

# Better Together
We'll acquire some bruises along the way as we bump our head, shoulders, knees and toes.. but I believe it's crucial for when y'all run into similar issues, that we've gone through a gauntlet together. That means this guide includes refactor reasoning and results. There's a lot of "play" that needs to happen with intrinsic layouts, **I want you to see how I play and reach resilient layouts.** That way you can do it too!

If you don't have the basics of grid or flexbox down, have no fear. **Y'all can pick up the basics & jargon along the way.** I'll do my best to provide links out to topics that I'm not going to cover but will touch upon. üëç
