Alright, **enough reading**, time for you to apply some of this stuff and play. **Yes, play!** I can read about grid all day and all it does is generally confuse me. These grid words didn't mean anything to me until I wrote them and they did something to the content. **I need both**, and so far, this guide has been all blah blah blah at you with gifs and pretty pictures. Time to flex the other half.

**Crack yer knuckles, time to tippy tappy the keys y'all.**
