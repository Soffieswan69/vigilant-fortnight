## Form anatomy

E-commerce forms are used to collect information from users to complete actions
such as product selection, sign-in and most importantly, checkout.

Forms have the following components:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th>Used to...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Input field</strong>
    </td>
    <td>Collect user input in the form of text, passwords or selection</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Label</strong>
    </td>
    <td>Describe input fields</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Call-to-action</strong>
    </td>
    <td>Perform actions like Add to Cart</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Validation</strong>
    </td>
    <td>Ensure data is valid before sending to server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Helper</strong>
    </td>
    <td>Provide hints and other helpful text to guide users</td>
  </tr>
</table>
